  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a third-year mathematics major at Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville, TN. My research background is primarily in experimental physics, but I hope to acquire some math research experience before heading to grad school. Beyond math and physics, I enjoy reading, cooking, and backpacking.</p>
