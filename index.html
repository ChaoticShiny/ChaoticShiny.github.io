  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a fourth-year mathematics major with a physics minor at Tennessee Tech University in Cookeville, TN, currently in the process of applying to the master's degree program in math at Tennessee Tech. Primarily, my research experience has been in experimental physics. Beyond math and physics, my interests include reading, cooking, and hiking.</p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>During the past year, Los Alamos has hired me to write simulations, perform analysis, and work on the experimental setup of an interdisciplinary experiment involving both nuclear physics and biology. Previously, I have been involved in data analysis and experimental setup for other nuclear physics projects. In math, my interests tend towards topology and statistics.</p>
